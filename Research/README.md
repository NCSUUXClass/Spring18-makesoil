## Long-term Goal  ##

Design and build a platform for MakeSoil that:

+ Is easy for users to understand and use
+ Motivates current user to make more contribution to the community
+ Attracts more people to join the activity

## Challenges  ##

### Understanding users and their needs ###

The goal of MakeSoil is trying to accomplish is relatively novel. There is little work that has been done in this area. Moreover, the MakeSoil project is at a very early stage. So, we have little data to access or refer that could help us with the design process. And the current MakeSoil website is very simple with minimum functionality and it does not have many active users. It will be challenging to find potential users who we can talk to and ask for feedback.

### Motivating people to use this application ###

The MakeSoil project doesn’t provide a strong conventional incentive such as personal or monetary benefit to its users. Their users must be solely motivated by the desire to create a sustainable world and help the planet. Thus, it might be challenging to attract the attention of potential users and generate more traffic to the website.

### Lack of experience ###

As fresh designers, not only will there be a steep learning curve to mastering the design tools and techniques, but we will also lack the expertise and design sense of a seasoned and experienced designer. Let alone that we desire putting forward some revolutionary designs.


## Experience Map ##

![](https://github.com/MakeSoil-UX/Research/blob/master/Experience%20Map.png)


### Description ###

There are two main actors in this experience map: Soil Maker and Soil Supporter. Soil Maker is people that own skills of turning food waste into soil. They collect waste food from Soil Supporter, people have plenty waste food to donate. The pile is the places soil maker collect waste food source. With the community growing, some people may assist in delivering food waste to soil maker and they are called Soil Supporter.

In our design, the main goal is that, soil supporter could successfully donate their food waste to soil maker, no matter by themselves or by the soil courier. First of all, to use this application, all users should log in their own account. Different actors can carry out different functions. For instance, soil maker could set up new piles or manage existing piles, while the soil supporter could only find appropriate food maker or food courier. After the soil supporter determine the soil maker/soil courier, they could make appointment with them. If the appointment is accepted by the soil maker/soil courier, the goal is considered being achieved, regardless of whether the offline delivery is achieved.

## Expert notes ##

We meet with the Tomas Gutierrez (CTO of MakeSoil) and Sunny Sangha (Coordinator). They described the mission of this project as well as things they have already accomplished before we joined. The goal of their company is to save our environment from recycling any food waste from individuals. They also provided some websites with similar functions to give us a basic demonstration what the UI could be.

Then we had some discussion about the user type of MakeSoil. Based on their description, the main users include soil supplier and soil maker. Soil supporter is people who supply the waste food to the soil maker, while soil maker is like a chemist who turn those food waste into soil. Also they mentioned the soil courier, which is a potential user who volunteers delivering food waste to soil maker. The website or app is the main platform where the two main characters can find and interact with each other to make the whole project work.

In the end, the clients suggested us using **Sketch** and **InVision**, which are professional design tools, to improve the efficiency and quality of our design.


## Problems ##

+ In what strategy or method should we use to motivate users to make more contribution?
+ How can soil maker contact the soil makers when they want to donate?
+ How can soil makers network and collaborate with each other?
+ How can the soil supporters locate their nearby soil makers to donate while not letting them knowing the exact location in the consideration of privacy?
+ How could soil maker let the soil supporter know what specific materials that they need to make soil?
+ How can the nearest soil courier be located to deliver the soil from the soil makers to the concerned soil users?
+ Which design tools should be use?

### Possible solutions ###

**About the strategy**: We discussed about the strategy. The current methods include visualizing users' contributions, putting pictures that showing the emergency (for protecting soil), and designing it like a game.

**About the location**: We would mask the exact location of soil maker with a appropriate range in order to protect the privacy of the soil maker. It is like marking the location on the map with a range instead of a point.

**About the design tool**: Our clients suggest us using Sketch and InVision. Sketch is OS dependent (only for iOS) and has no option to collaborate. It needs us to work independently and merge the work later. On the other hand, Figma is a better choice since it is OS independent with similar functions. So in the end we choose to use Figma with InVision.

## Opportunities ##

+ Helping the soil makers decide on which soil supporters to get the waste from.
+ Providing the soil makers with precise information on the different soil supporters located nearby.
+ Structuring the information for comparing different wastes sources.
+ Providing  search results in terms of statistics graph and figures so that it is easier to make comparisons and choose a particular soil supporter.
+ Attracting soil makers and couriers on the basis of amount of soil made and delivered.
+ Addressing the lack of information on the available soil makers and soil supporters.
+ Extracting information from already available database, and upgrade the database by gathering nuanced information.
+ Improving usability by improving aesthetics, ultimately providing a good user experience.


## Main Target ##

**Soil Makers**: those who have mastered the alchemy of turning food scraps into living soil — or those who are learning to.

**Soil Supporters**: those who no longer want to be part of the 35 million tons of food waste sent to landfills each year. They offer their food scraps to nearby heaps, which the Soil Makers shepherd back into nourishing soil.
